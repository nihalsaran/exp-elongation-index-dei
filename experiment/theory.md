### Theory

The elongation index of the aggregate is defined as the percentage by weight of the particles of aggregate whose greatest dimension is greater than 1.8 times their mean dimensions.  

The elongated particles may result in cracks in the pavement since they get broken down easily upon being subjected to heavy loads. Also, the elongated particles have a high ratio of surface area to volume. This results in low workability of the concrete creating difficulty in the construction work. Therefore,  it is important to determine the elongation index value of aggregates before using them at the site.  

The elongation index of course aggregates for pavement should not exceed 15% .
